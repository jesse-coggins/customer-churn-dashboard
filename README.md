# Customer Churn Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a customer churn dashboard designed for executive decision-making. Its purpose is to help leadership understand who is churning, where churn is concentrated, and which customer attributes are most associated with customer loss.

The best public home for this project is Tableau Public. This GitHub repo is intended to serve as the companion shell with project context, screenshots, and a link to the published dashboard.

## Coursework Context
This repository packages work originally completed as part of Western Governors University's (WGU) M.S. in Data Analytics program and reorganizes it into a public portfolio format. Report-extracted screenshots are still preserved in `assets/report-extracts/`, and cleaner dashboard captures from Tableau Desktop are included directly below.
